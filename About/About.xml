<size=24>About</size>
================================================================

Expands the options for storing stuff by providing Extended Storage-derived buildings in a new 'Storage' menu.

<size=24>Contents</size>
================================================================

There is a limit to Steam description readibility and size.  The breakdown or what building does what is availible online at:

<size=24>KNOWN ISSUES</size>
================================================================

<size=18>Meat Hooks visual glitch</size>
--------------------------------

The game will throw a "missing image" icon (the bright magenta X in a cell) once the corpses are moved onto the output stack (the part of the building that holds the biggest 'stack' of corpses). I know why it's doing this, but I can't address it yet.  I have not found any gameplay issues associated with it.  Once the last corpse is removed, the missing image icon disappears.  If this is unacceptable - don't build Meat Hooks.

<size=18>Only Top weapon is right-click selectable</size>
--------------------------------

Unlike Extended Storage Clothes racks, there is no supporting code to 'Equip' any weapon other than the one on the 'top' of the stack in the container building.  The C# coding needed to implement is a bit beyond me at the moment, but I am making progress.
