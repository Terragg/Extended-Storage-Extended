<size=18>Meat Hooks visual glitch</size>
--------------------------------
The game may throw a "missing image" icon (the bright magenta X in a cell) once the corpses are moved onto the output stack (the part of the building that holds the biggest 'stack' of corpses). I am looking into why it does this, but I have not found any gameplay issues associated with it.  Once the last corpse is removed, the missing image icon disappears too.  If this is unacceptable - don't build Meat Hooks.
