<h2>KNOWN ISSUES</h2>
<hr size="2"/>

<h3>Meat Hooks visual glitch</h3>
<hr />
<p>The game will throw a "missing image" icon (the bright magenta X in a cell) once the corpses are moved onto the output stack (the part of the building that holds the biggest 'stack' of corpses). I know why it's doing this, but I can't address it yet.  I have not found any gameplay issues associated with it.  Once the last corpse is removed, the missing image icon disappears.  If this is unacceptable - don't build Meat Hooks.<p>

<h3>Only Top weapon is right-click selectable</h3>
<hr />
<p>Unlike Extended Storage Clothes racks, there is no supporting code to 'Equip' any weapon other than the one on the 'top' of the stack in the container building.  The C# coding needed to implement is a bit beyond me at the moment, but I am making progress.</p>
