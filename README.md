# Extended Storage - now Extended! #
## About ##

There is a limit to Steam description readibility and size.  The breakdown or what building does what is availible online at:

## KNOWN ISSUES ##
------

### Meat Hooks visual glitch ###
------

The game will throw a "missing image" icon (the bright magenta X in a cell) once the corpses are moved onto the output stack (the part of the building that holds the biggest 'stack' of corpses). I know why it's doing this, but I can't address it yet.  I have not found any gameplay issues associated with it.  Once the last corpse is removed, the missing image icon disappears.  If this is unacceptable - don't build Meat Hooks.

### Only Top weapon is right-click selectable ###
------

Unlike Extended Storage Clothes racks, there is no supporting code to 'Equip' any weapon other than the one on the 'top' of the stack in the container building.  The C# coding needed to implement is a bit beyond me at the moment, but I am making progress.
